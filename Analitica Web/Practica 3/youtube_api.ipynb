I\\'m continuing to use Arc mostly out of inertia. It\\'s yet another in a long list of disappointments when it comes to browsers. I was initially enthusiastic, but this faded as the company failed to address some glaring problems. I have doubts the company will survive. After all, nobody in my family has even bothered to try Arc, even after seeing me using it extensively, partly replacing Edge.\\n\\nThe biggest disappointments for me are the Little Arc,  the way Arc deals with history, and the fact that Arc closes your tabs \"automatically\". I\\'ve used web browsers since the very beginnings of the web. These are possibly the worst ideas I\\'ve ever seen in any browser.\\n\\nI\\'ve struggled to understand what the point of the Little Arc even is. For the company to commit to a UI feature that intrusive and bizarre, with so many big negatives, you would think there must be something really valuable it accomplishes. So far, what this is, has eluded my best efforts to discover. If someone has cracked this mystery, let me know.\\n\\nThen, even worse is the way Arc deals with history, in that it can close a tab as part of backing up through history. Really? That\\'s a change from how browsers have worked for decades. Does that make even a slight bit of sense, that the tab you\\'re in can actually disappear right out from under you while you\\'re working, by design?\\n\\nI\\'m willing to consider changes that overturn decades of established precedent, provided there\\'s a large enough reward. With this, it seems they changed the way history works ... to make it worse. This problem alone is basically a show stopper. I can\\'t continue using Arc with this problem, and I\\'m strongly advising other people not to even bother trying out Arc.\\n\\nAnyway, you get the idea.

Once toggled on, they pop up here, there and everywhere. Often super useful, and sometimes, they\\'re just there, using up compute yo pay for. Not surprised it\\'s the nr 1 feature, it\\'s an auto-feature, where as say search/ask a page is an on demand feature.\\n2) I had to switch off smart tabs and downloads. Sometimes the AI gets it right, and often it does things that kinda make sense, but end up adding more work. e.g. you download three files from a series, say video-1, video-2 and video3.mp4 given the context the AI gets, they could all end up being renamed to website-video.mp4. Even more so I found sometimes the AI strips the one word that\\'s really the differentiator. So cute for say calendar invites or ZIP files from google images. But not always useful.\\nLong story short, is there still bit of \"how could we throw AI to solve a problem that doesn\\'t really exist?\"\\n\\nAnd Mobile: For what it\\'s worth, the single most important feature for me is to \"send a page to desktop\" when I found something on mobile I want to refer to later. e.g. a long article I want to refer to when I can take proper notes... I don\\'t even need full sync, not sure I\\'d want a big list of tabs to scroll through on mobile, if anything I need less tabs on mobile. :) But without some sort of sync/push to other device, a mobile browser is always going to be half-useful for me.

The improvements in 1.3 are all great, the way you talk and the whole spirit is great... I just made Arc my default browser yesterday, created 6 spaces and populated them with tabs I will regularly need. Checked out many functions, and I loved it.\\nNow, however, I\\'d like to share a few observations and concerns:\\n1/ Some UI elements have slightly too low contrast, e.g. the inactive space icons in the bottom of the sidebar (I chose your icons instead of emojis). Hard to see. It may be very personal due to my rather bad vision, but I\\'m always frustrated by aesthetically pleasing while almost invisible things on the screen, like the very popular light gray text, in a very light font, on a dark white background...\\n2/ I use a 16\" MBP with M1 Max with huge RAM. It always runs very cold, the fans hardly ever move. Arc made them spin, I could feel the warmth on the palmrest and the bottom, then I checked and Arc used 197% CPU... I checked with identical content (this YT video of yours) rendered in only two app-windows, one Safari, one Arc. Safari used 58% CPU, Arc used 180% CPU. This is very basic and you should focus on it (I know, the Windows version takes now 70% of your resources...)\\n3/ This morning, restarting Arc, it said something about a missing Keychain item, which I stupidly dismissed, but no Arc window can be opened since then... that\\'s why I got down to write this...\\nSo now default is back to Safari, but I like Arc so much, I will watch out for news and developments, and when you are ready, I am ready...

I want to know the philosophies that Arc leans towards. As a fan, I want to be inspired by these philosophies.\\n\\nThe first question here is AUTHORSHIP. For some this looks like censorship based on religious beliefs and for me might look like turning all my favorite websites green. These both seems great. But how about the censorship of content I dislike? Would Arc build features to let me build an internet that ONLY holds my same, self-reinforcing beliefs or does arc believe I should sometimes eat some vegetables. I‚Äôd lean towards an internet where everyone eats vegetables (but they can still be my favorite color). \\n\\nAnother question is PRIVACY. We see here with the gaming kids how the internet cafes are a place to be free in ways their homes may not be‚Ä¶ Perhaps because you can have your best friend next to you and get to play the games YOU want to play without your parents being upset. The trouble here is that underlying most privacy concerns is a sense of FEAR. Fear that your data would be used against you, fear you are being watched, also fear you will be caught doing something you probably shouldn‚Äôt be doing in the first place (esp. illegal). \\n\\nDoes Arc stand for a privacy that acknowledges fear? Or does arc stand for a different outlook, perhaps one that seeks to establish more trust online.

Honestly for the typical user, it's probably fine to reduce the amount of power needed for personal computers as browsing twitter and streaming videos and music and shopping online is the bulk of the common persons activities, in that sense an internet computer is probably fine (but perhaps at that point it is even overkill?)\\n\\nSomewhat disappointed that there's not much actual mention on what the BROWSER is going to look like moving forward. On the browser side, currently Arc is only on MacOS it's even more of a disadvantage in being unable to compete in energy draw and feature set (think touchid, apple pay, true handoff, etc). Another comment dropped on the video mentions it, but right now the browser is not there yet; multi tasking is even more clunky with the new introduction of split tabs, customizations are lacking (perhaps by choice), to be honest besides the easel and the new live capture feature I can't say my experience has been all that different from just using firefox or safari.\\n\\nAs another comment also mentions, it worries me that it is starting to feel like Arc is starting to move in a direction like that of facebook where the user is the product. Hopefully that's not the case, but I've yet to hear about a monetization strategy for the internet computers or the browser itself. Though if Arc truly proves to be a useful product, I wouldn't mind this anyways.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Arc seems unfocused. Building an internet computer at the very least implies generalization of tasks, and there will always be a product that exists that does one part that Arc can produce but infinitely better. Either way hopefully the future of the company is bright, perhaps I can even join the company some day.\", 'replies': ['To add on, a great boon to adoption of applications is allowing users to share their setups. Maybe the Arc team should look into a market place for boosts.', 'I can only double on that! While I like the way Arc is transforming the browser landscape, it will be definitely not the final thing. I doubt that we will use browsers as we know them today in ten years from now. With the rise of AR glasses and the rumor that Apple is entering this market, personal computing will dramatically transform again in the next years. As soon as this devices get market ready, more and more people will use them and the PC will vanish, as it is already. Less and less people have computers, everybody uses their smartphone to order, research and messaging. Only creatives that produce the stuff which is used on smartphones and browser will rely on PCs.\\n\\nSo, after a long message/reply a question to The Browser Company: What is your plan to really transform the web and what is your plan when the screen your are developing for is not existing anymore?', \"Great point Maurice! In fact I'll tack on a more selfish question/ask, maybe an iPad implementation of Arc should be on the roadmap somewhere? Personal computing is already beyond just laptops, and clearly even today Apple is trying to market the iPad as a replacement. I saw a video of someone using arc on their iPad through sidecar and honestly Arc seems even more suited for tablets than laptops (apple pencil + easel synergy) I could definitely see users primarily using Arc (or even living in) for most thing on a tablet which greatly lends itself to the internet computer/chrome os type direction. iOS16 seems to be opening up apple pay to 3rd party webkit based browsers so a webkit Arc could be much more competitive if the changes also come to MacOS/iPadOS\", \"Using Chromium instead of WebKit or even Servo is very telling. Google's push for replacing Web Requests in Manifest V3, which handicap extensions like uBlock Origin, will take even more privacy away from the user and allow for Google to further their stranglehold on the internet. Although I'm not aware of TBC's stance on this, their apparent aversion to discuss the topic is at least worth considering before jumping fully onboard. I understand that Chromium is the engine that gets the most development attention currently, but wouldn't such a supposed drastic change in paradigm warrant choosing something less controlled by Google? Especially when the vision Josh mentions is something that we're already seeing in Chromebooks.\"]}, {'comment': 'Keep up the good work! Such an amazing browser - truly best in class.

I would love to have filesystem integrated completely with cloud (90% of my files are already synced after each change with MEGA drive) or web apps that see cloud as filesystem, but I'm afraid there is way too many obstacles on the road to make this happen without complete revolution supported by all the major tech companies.
